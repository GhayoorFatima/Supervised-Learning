# Supervised-Learning
Supervised learning is a machine learning technique where models train on labeled data to predict outcomes for new inputs. Itâ€™s used for classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., price prediction). With applications in healthcare, finance, and more, it drives innovation by solving diverse real-world problems effectively.
